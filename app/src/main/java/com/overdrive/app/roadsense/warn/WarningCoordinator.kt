/**
 * Decides WHEN to warn the driver about an upcoming hazard and HOW (audio chime /
 * visual cue / both), honoring every gate (D-010 distance, D-015 confidence,
 * R-SET-4 per-severity, R-EXT-4 direction).
 *
 * ## Where it sits
 * Driven by the daemon controller's periodic tick (NOT the 100 Hz IMU path). On
 * each tick the controller hands it the live [Pose] + the current config snapshot;
 * this queries the store for hazards ahead (via [ApproachEngine]), picks the most
 * imminent one that passes the gates, and fires at most one warning per hazard.
 *
 * ## The gates (all must pass)
 *  1. feature + warnings enabled, and severity/confidence pass [RoadSenseConfig.Snapshot.warnsFor]
 *  2. hazard is AHEAD within the forward cone (ApproachEngine already filtered this)
 *  3. range ≤ dynamic alert distance `d = max(v·t_w, floor)` (D-010)
 *  4. we haven't already warned for THIS hazard id on this approach (dedupe)
 *
 * ## Audio
 * Uses the injected [AudioCue]. The production controller installs
 * [BridgedAudioCue] to play the bundled severity chime through the selected OEM
 * audio channels; [ToneAudioCue] remains the standalone fallback. Visual cues
 * are delegated to a [VisualSink] the overlay implements, keeping this class
 * overlay-agnostic + unit-testable.
 *
 * Not thread-safe; called from the single controller tick thread.
