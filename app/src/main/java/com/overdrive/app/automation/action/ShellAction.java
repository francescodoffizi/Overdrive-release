/**
 * Automation action that runs a shell command in the daemon (UID 2000).
 *
 * <p>This is the most powerful — and most dangerous — action, because automations
 * fire <b>autonomously</b> on vehicle events (not a deliberate button press like
 * the key-mapping shell hatch). A misfiring automation could run its command
 * repeatedly on its own. So it is gated behind a DEDICATED opt-in flag,
 * {@code automation.allowShell} (toggle on the Automations page), SEPARATE from
 * the key-mapping "Advanced actions" toggle ({@code keymap.allowAdvanced}) —
 * enabling shell for a hand-pressed key must NOT silently also arm autonomous
 * shell in automations.
 * When the flag is off, {@link #trigger} is a logged no-op; the command never
 * executes.
 *
 * <p>Runs in the daemon process, the same context {@code Automations.update}
 * evaluates in, so {@code Runtime.exec} has the daemon's privileges — the same
 * path {@code KeymapApiHandler} uses for the key-mapping shell action.
 *
 * <p>The command supports {@code ${var:NAME}} / {@code ${signal:TYPE}} substitution,
 * restricted to NUMERIC values — see {@link #interpolateNumeric}. That restriction is a
 * security boundary, not a convenience: variables are externally writable (an MQTT broker
 * can push arbitrary text into automation state via
 * {@code Automations.publishMqttTrigger}), and this string is handed to {@code sh -c} as
 * UID 2000. Substituting free text would let a broker inject shell metacharacters into a
 * privileged command line. For arithmetic, compute it in a Calculate Variable action and
 * reference the result — the shell's own {@code $((…))} is left to the shell.
