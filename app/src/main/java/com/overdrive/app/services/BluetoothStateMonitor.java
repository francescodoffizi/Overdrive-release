/**
 * App-process Bluetooth-connection watcher. The daemon (UID 2000, synthetic Context)
 * cannot reliably read Bluetooth — the framework {@link BluetoothAdapter} proxies and a
 * {@code dumpsys bluetooth_manager} parse are both flaky from a shell UID; Bluetooth is
 * only reliably readable from a normal app process. So this runs in the real app process
 * (started from {@link KeepAliveAccessibilityService}, which is always alive) and RELAYS
 * each connection transition to the daemon via {@link DaemonHttpClient} →
 * {@code POST /api/automations/event}, exactly like {@link CallStateMonitor}. The daemon
 * publishes the whitelisted {@code btState} / {@code btDeviceName} automation events (see
 * {@code Automations.publishExternalEvent}), enabling "when my phone connects" / "only
 * while <name> is connected" rules.
 *
 * <p><b>Detection.</b> Ground truth is resolved by reflecting the hidden
 * {@code BluetoothAdapter.getConnectDevices()} (note the spelling — no "e") and treating a
 * non-empty result as connected, reading the device's {@code getName()} (falling back to
 * {@code getAddress()}). When that hidden method is absent we fall back to iterating
 * {@code getBondedDevices()} + the hidden {@code BluetoothDevice.isConnected()}. The
 * connect/disconnect broadcasts ({@code ACL_CONNECTED} / {@code ACL_DISCONNECTED} /
 * adapter {@code STATE_CHANGED}) are only used as a cheap wake signal — the authoritative
 * state is always re-resolved by the reflection read.
 *
 * <p>Singleton + idempotent {@link #start}: the a11y service can re-bind and call
 * start() repeatedly; a second call is a no-op while already registered. Every read is
 * best-effort and never throws, so a Bluetooth-stack hiccup can't disrupt the process.
