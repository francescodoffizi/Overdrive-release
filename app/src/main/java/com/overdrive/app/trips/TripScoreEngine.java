/**
 * Single-Pass Kinematic Scoring Engine for Driving DNA.
 *
 * Processes the entire telemetry array in ONE pass, computing all five Driving DNA
 * scores, micro-moments, avg/max speed, and kinematic state
 * classification simultaneously. On a 2-hour 5Hz drive (36,000 samples), this
 * touches the array exactly once — critical for constrained car head unit hardware
 * where cache thrashing and memory bandwidth are real concerns.
 *
 * Architecture:
 *   1. Single O(N) loop accumulates all accumulators and state machines in parallel
 *   2. Post-loop finalization converts accumulators into scores
 *   3. Micro-moments (launches, coast-brake, smoothness) are extracted inline
 *      using state machines rather than separate passes
 *
 * Scoring axes (all five computed in the single pass):
 *   - Anticipation: EV-aware coast gap detection (accel < 5% = regen lift-off);
 *     credits coasts that end via brake, power re-application, light throttle, OR
 *     rolling to a stop — so one-pedal driving is rewarded, not penalized.
 *   - Smoothness: mean per-driving-sample pedal jerk (|Δaccel| + |Δbrake|),
 *     idle samples excluded, each sample's jerk winsorized so one panic stop
 *     can't crater the score.
 *   - Speed Discipline: rolling-window speed stddev, GPS spikes winsorized.
 *   - Efficiency: kWh/km against a single state-dependent band. The caller
 *     (TripAnalyticsManager) resolves energy — BMS kWh or SoC×nominal-capacity —
 *     into trip.energyPerKm BEFORE this runs, so there is exactly one unit axis.
 *   - Consistency: INTRA-trip behavioral uniformity — the coefficient of
 *     variation of per-window pedal demand (Welford, single-pass). Erratic
 *     "slam-then-coast" driving raises CV → lowers the score; a steady profile
 *     (uniformly calm OR uniformly assertive) scores high. This matches the
 *     user-facing definition and replaces the old trip-to-trip efficiency
 *     deviation (which was unit-confused and stuck at 0).
 *
 * Normalization & confidence
 * ───────────────────────────
 * Every axis maps its metric through {@link #smoothScore} (a logistic S-curve)
 * instead of a linear (1 - x/max) clamp, so real drivers spread across the
 * range rather than piling at the 0/100 rails. Each axis also computes a
 * coverage∈[0,1] — how much of the trip actually exercised that axis — and the
 * final score is shrunk toward the neutral 50 by coverage:
 *
 *     final = round(50 + coverage * (raw - 50))
 *
 * So a trip that couldn't measure an axis lands honestly near 50 (no magic
 * sentinel), and overall = mean/5 stays meaningful. Coverage is logged.
 *
 * All scores are integers in [0, 100] where 100 is optimal.

     * the old linear {@code (1 - value/max)} clamp did.
     *
     * <p>The two reference points define the curve:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>{@code value == good} → ~85</li>
     *   <li>midpoint of good/bad → 50</li>
     *   <li>{@code value == bad}  → ~15</li>

     * anticipation gap) and lower-is-better axes ({@code good < bad}, e.g. jerk)
     * — the sign of the half-width handles the direction. Extreme inputs
     * compress toward 0/100 asymptotically rather than clamping, and negative
     * values are fine (e.g. regen-positive kWh/km on a descent).
